Solar System Simulation 🌍
Welcome to the Solar System Simulation! This interactive web project allows you to explore the planets in our solar system. Each planet rotates around the Sun, and you can hover or tap on them to learn more about their unique characteristics.

Features ✨
Realistic Planetary Orbits: Planets rotate around the Sun at different speeds, mimicking their real-life orbits.

Interactive Planets: Hover or tap on any planet to view its details.

Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

Stunning Visuals: A galaxy background with twinkling stars and a glowing Sun.

Educational: Learn interesting facts about each planet in our solar system.

Technologies Used 🛠️
HTML: Structure of the web page.

CSS: Styling and animations (e.g., planet orbits, hover effects).

JavaScript: Interactivity (e.g., displaying planet details on hover/touch).
